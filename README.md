# [Easy Vape](https://easyvape.herokuapp.com/)

EasyVape is a E-Commerce webpage, produced as my final project in [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/). This is a fullstack website, which "sells" Vapes and E-Juices made by EasyVape, which is a fictional company.

The main technologies used were HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery, Python and Django. All images were created using [Dall-E-2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/)
